"""Grow food at the farm a starving, wounded player is already standing beside.

Health only regenerates at food 18, and survival recovery refuses blind
exploration while health is critical. Where no passive animal is in range
that is a closed loop: no food, so no health, so no search for food. A
checkpointed farm a short walk away is the one food source that needs
neither: bread from carried wheat, mature wheat from the plot, and seeds
replanted from where the player stands.
