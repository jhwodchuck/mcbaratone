"""Plan safe 1x2 tunnels through a local block map. Pure logic, no bridge calls.

A walkable tunnel cell is a *feet* cell: the cell and the one above it must be
open, and the cell below must be solid ground. Moving one cell horizontally
may also step one cell down or up (a staircase), which needs one extra
clearance cell. ``required_cells`` is the single source of truth for that
geometry; the miner digs exactly those cells and nothing else.

Safety is decided here, before any block is touched:

* never open or stand beside lava or water (a flooded tunnel kills a bot);
* never break into a natural cave (open air below the surface that our own
  tunnels did not make), because a cave is where the skeletons are;
* never dig a column with gravel or sand over its head;
* only break stone, soil, plants and ores. A chest, spawner, rail, plank or
  anything else unrecognised makes the cell impassable, which also keeps the
  planner out of mineshafts and structures.
