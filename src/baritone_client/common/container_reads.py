"""Deciding what a block read at a catalogued container coordinate proves.

The bridge answers ``get_block`` for any coordinate in a chunk the client has
not loaded with ``minecraft:void_air``, and with an empty id when the read
itself failed. Neither says anything about whether a container is still there.

Treating those as "absent" is destructive and effectively irreversible:
``StorageCatalog.mark_missing`` retires the entry, and ``list_containers``,
``find_item`` and ``item_count`` all filter ``status!='missing'``, so nothing
ever re-probes a coordinate once it has been written off.

Measured on A1Bot 2026-08-16: 29 of 49 catalogued containers had been retired,
13 through this path, including (-351, 79, 95) which the same bot had opened
successfully an hour earlier. With its nearby storage erased it set out on a
~400 block walk to a spawn-era chest to unload a full inventory, and
FOOD_AND_IRON made no progress for hours.

The same rule is applied to terrain in ``terraform_verify`` and to portals in
``nether``; this module is the storage-side statement of it.
