# `defend_or_flee` advances the shared defense state machine by exactly one
# tick. Its EVADE branch is explicitly written on the assumption that a
# threat still present after a failed escape gets retried "immediately on
# the next tick" (see combat.py, next to should_escalate_to_combat) -- that
# is how DefenseRuntime.consecutive_evade_failures is meant to reach its
# escalation threshold. Every other caller of defend_or_flee in this
# codebase loops it tightly inside one continuous action, so that
# assumption holds for them. This opportunity handler was the exception: the
# adaptive scheduler only reaches SELF_DEFENSE once per outer cycle
# (observed 10-14s, gated by opportunity priority against everything else),
# so a single call here starved the escalation counter of the fast retries
# it needs -- a bot could spend minutes alternating between a live threat
# and ordinary fleet work, only ever escalating to fight-back once health
# separately dropped into the unrelated critical-health recovery gate.
# Retrying here, inside this one bounded opportunity call, gives the state
# machine the "next tick" it already assumes, without changing the shared
# state machine, its thresholds, or any other (already tightly-looping)
# caller's behavior.
