"""Keep a usable sword and pickaxe, in any phase, from cheap local materials.

Armour upkeep dressed the bot, but nothing ever asked "can you still fight?".
Live A1 2026-09-28: its only sword was an iron one at 247/250 damage, which
`combat_loadout.weapon_score` rightly refuses (three uses left), so every
defence ended in `attack_declined:weapon_unavailable`. It carried 73
cobblestone and sticks -- a stone sword is one craft away -- and died to a
single zombie beside its own house. It had no pickaxe at all either, so the
armour-recovery mining stage could never produce iron.

Stone is the default: cobblestone is plentiful at any base and the bot's few
ingots are reserved for armour. Wood is the fallback when no cobblestone is
carried.
