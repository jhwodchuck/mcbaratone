"""Stop a blocked bot from camping in place forever.

A scheduling hold is meant to be temporary: wait out the night, let health
regenerate, let a creeper wander off. Nothing bounded it, so a bot whose
blocker never clears holds forever. Bot18 -- the fleet's food worker -- stood
healthy and well fed inside a nest of 26 hostiles for hours, unable to satisfy
``nearby_hostiles == 0`` and unable to conclude that the spot was the problem.
The fleet starved while its food worker waited politely.

Two facts made it invisible. ``escalation_level`` was computed and never read
by anything, and ``record_productive_attempt`` only fires when an attempt
actually runs -- so a bot that holds never increments a no-progress streak at
all. Camping was not merely tolerated, it was unmeasured.

The rule here: a hold is a decision to do nothing, and repeated decisions to
do nothing are a failure. After enough of them, leave. Relocation may end
badly -- the new ground may be worse, the trip may kill the bot -- but a bot
that dies resolves, while a bot that camps produces nothing and reports
nothing anyone can act on.

Movement runs as recovery navigation on purpose. The critical-health travel
gate refuses long routes below the regeneration floor, and a starving camped
bot is exactly who needs to move; gating the escape on the condition the
escape relieves is the deadlock this module exists to break.
