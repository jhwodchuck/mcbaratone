"""A standing iron stockpile: mine when stock runs low, smelt, and bank the rest.

Iron used to come from one phase (`FOOD_AND_IRON`) that is marked done once and
never reopens, so a bot that died and lost its kit could not get iron back, and
the only repeatable path (armour recovery) mined only with armour already worn.
Live A1 2026-10-01: 400+ iron ore within 96 blocks of the base, 3 ingots held,
0 armour, no iron-getting step eligible at all.

The repo's other iron job, `common.iron_supply.run_iron_cycle`, belongs to the
dedicated fleet *iron supplier* role: it mines with Baritone's `mine` and needs
a sibling roster to be assigned to a bot at all. A lone balanced bot such as A1
never gets it, so this module is separate on purpose and mines with the
bounded `tunnel_miner` instead of `mine`.

This is that step. It is offered through the armour-upkeep opportunity whenever
carried plus banked iron falls below ``LOW_STOCK``. A trip digs one staircase
from a safe surface entrance (reused on later trips), mines the nearest iron
with ``tunnel_miner`` and its planner, retraces its own trail, smelts, and keeps
only an armour set's worth on the bot: a bot that dies 50 times a day must not
carry the stockpile.
